# Matrix2Latex
This is a repo containing implementations of a function with syntax
```
matrix2latex(file, matrix),
```
which writes a matrix vector, or scalar to a file.
The function is implemented in a number of different scripting languages:
  * Matlab
  * R
  * Julia
  * python

This can be used with `\input` in latex in for example a `bmatrix` environment.

There is also a rogue project of making a `figure2latex` function, though it is harder to make generic.
